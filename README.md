# Social-Media-Mental-Health-Indicators-Dataset 🧠📱

A data analysis and machine learning project that explores the relationship between social media usage behaviour and mental health indicators using a curated dataset.

---
### 📎 Dataset

This repository uses the Social Media Mental Health Indicators Dataset, a labeled dataset capturing the relationship between social media usage patterns, screen-time behaviours, daily lifestyle factors, and indicators related to mental health status.

#### 🔗 Kaggle Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sonalshinde123/social-media-mental-health-indicators-dataset

The dataset contains survey responses and labels that can be used for exploratory data analysis and machine learning models for classification or prediction related to mental health outcomes.

### 🧠 Project Overview

This project includes:

✔ Data exploration and visualization of relationships between social media behaviour and mental health indicators  
✔ Preprocessing and cleaning of the dataset  
✔ Correlation analysis of features  
✔ Machine learning models to predict mental health outcomes  
✔ Insights into the impact of social media usage patterns on mental health  

Typical analysis approaches could include:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forests)
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1 score, confusion matrix)

### 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sonalshinde24/Social-Media-Mental-Health-Indicators-Dataset.git
cd Social-Media-Mental-Health-Indicators-Dataset
```

2. Download the dataset from the Kaggle link above and place it inside the repository or a local data folder.

3. Open notebook or script in your environment  
e.g., open the Jupyter notebook (*.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab.

4. Run all cells / execute scripts to perform analysis and model training.
The dataset and analysis can be used for student-level projects, research exploration, or prototype modeling of text and numeric social media indicators.

### 🛠️ Requirements

Install the necessary libraries before running:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```

You can also run the notebook in Google Colab or similar cloud notebook environments without local setup.

### 📊 Insights You Can Extract

By exploring this dataset and running the analysis, you can:
- Identify patterns that correlate heavy social media use with mental health indicators
- Build classification models to predict mental health risk based on usage and survey features
- Visualize how behaviours like screen-time, notification frequency, and app interaction relate to psychological states
